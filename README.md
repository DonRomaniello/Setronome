Rep tempo can give you a lot of information about whether you are using the right amount of resistance to safely optimize your training.

While it may be theatrically impressive to train to absolute failure, this is neither safe nor efficient. Training to technical failure is likely more effective, and reduces the chances that you will injure yourself and lose weeks to recovery.

## Acceleration is the answer

Thankfully, our bodies will tell us whether we are using enough resistance by simply slowing down. Instead of laborious and distracting video analysis, it makes more sense to simply use the accelerometer included in every single smart phone to track the tempo of a set.
